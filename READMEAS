My name is Angela and I'm a career changer from IT Project Management/Database Administration to Software Engineering. I started my career in IT about 10 years ago after my first career change from Graphic Design. I've worked with databases including Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle, and SAP either implementing, training end users, project management or administrating daily operations. Most recently I was working as the IT project manager for a web development team but was laid off due to COVID. 

It has always been my dream to get into software development but it was hard to find the time to sit down and learn enough about the technologies to land a job. Over the years I've studied javascript, ruby, python, java, html and CSS but just had a very basic knowledge. Being able to join Revature is a great opportunity and will hopefully get me started on my new career path.
